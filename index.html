<h1><em> 2018 Trip to Niagara Falls </em> </h2>
<p>We had a few days between Reunions and decided to see Niagara Falls on the Canadian
side.  We stayed at the Hilton right across the street from the Casino. We had a view of the 
American falls which lit up with red, white and blue at night, very nice.</p>
