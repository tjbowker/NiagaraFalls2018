<h1><em> 2018 Trip to Niagara on the Lake </em> </h2>
<p>There was a beautiful town north of Niagara Falls up the river where it spills
into Lake Ontario. Founded by British loyalists who fled from America in 1812
the architecture is European and they are in wine country. There was action there during the 
war of 1812 at Queenston Hts where we ate lunch. The restaurants and shops are quaint and
a must see. We rented bikes and rode all the way to Queenston on a bike trail along 
the Niagara River, it took three hours. This tour is highly recomended.</p>
